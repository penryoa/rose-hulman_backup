Reflection Questions:

1. How are your two (Warm-Up vs. Stage 1) designs different? Which do you think is superior and why? If you think they are equally good/bad explain why.





2. After implementing your design, did you have to change the original UML? If so, what did you have to change and why did you have to change it? If not, explain how you made your decisions in designing.





3. If you were to use your original code (from the Warm Up) and try to use it to match the explicit requirements of Stage 1, do you think it would be easier or harder to code than the re-designed UML? Why? (You are permitted to try to actually implement it if you want to in order to help answer this question)





4. Select two or more specific design principles and discuss how they relate to the your experience in designing and implementing the code for Stage 1.
