"""
Demonstrates:
  -- LOOPS (doing something repeatedly) and
  -- using OBJECTS
via Turtle Graphics.

Concepts include:
 * Using OBJECTS:
   -- CONSTRUCT an INSTANCE of a CLASS (we call such instances OBJECTS).
   -- Make an object  ** DO **  something by using a METHOD.
   -- Reference an object's  ** DATA **  by using an INSTANCE VARIABLE.

 * LOOPS:
   -- Using a FOR expresssion like this:
         for k in range(41):
             blah
             blah
             blah

     The above repeats the body of the FOR expression 41 times.
     The name  k  is:
            0 the first time the body runs,
       then 1 the next time the body runs,
       then 2 the next time the body runs,
         etc
       then 40 the last time the body runs.

 * ASSIGNMENT and NAMES
  -- ASSIGNING a VALUE to a NAME (VARIABLE), as in these examples:
        jack = 45
        jill = 'ran down the hill'
        size = size - 12
  -- The computer's STATE during a run of a program is the set
       of current values of all the names that the computer is tracking.

 * The DOT trick: Type expressions like the following,
     pausing after typing the DOT (period, full stop).
     The window that pops up give lots of clues for what you can do!

        rg.Pen().
        rg.PaintBucket()
