# This line is a COMMENT -- a note to human readers of this file.
# When a program runs, it ignores everything from a  # (hash)  mark
# to the end of the line with the  #  mark.
#
# We call files that have Python code in them MODULES.  Line 1 of this
# module (look at it now) prints onto the Console the STRING
#   Hello, World
# Anything surrounded by quote marks (single or double) is a STRING.

# TODO: 1.
#   (Yes, that means for YOU to DO things per these instructions:)
#
#   Run this module by right clicking anywhere in this window and select
#        Run 'name of file'
#   After running, find the Console tab (below) and confirm that
#        Hello, World
#   did indeed get printed (displayed) on the Console.

# TODO: 2.
#   Notice the small horizontal BLUE bars on the scrollbar-like thing
#   on the right.  Each blue bar indicates a TO DO in this module.
#
#     a. You can use the blue bars to go from one TO DO to the next
#        by clicking on the blue bars.  ** Try that now. **
#
#     b. When you have completed a TO DO, you should change the word
#          TODO
#        to
#          DONE.
#        Try it now on line 16 above, and note that its blue bar on
#        the scrollbar-like thing to the right has gone away.
#
# If you change TODOs to DONEs like this, you can tell when you have
# finished all the exercises in a module -- there will be no blue bars
# left on the scrollbar-like thing to the right.
#
# You have now completed TO DO #2, so change its TO DO on line 29 to DONE
# (and proceed similarly for all forthcoming TODOs in this course).

# TODO: 3.
#   Add another   print   statement below.
#   It should print any string that you want (but keep it G-rated!)
#   Test your code by re-running this module using either the right click
#       method again or by using the play button in the upper right.
#   Look at the Console to be sure that your string printed as expected.
#

# TODO: 4.
#   Add yet another   print   statement.
#   This one should print the *product* of 3,607 and 34,227.
#   Let the computer do the arithmetic for you (no calculators!).
#   You do NOT have to use strings for this, so no quotation marks!
#
#   TEST your code by re-running this module, then asking someone
#   whom you trust:  What number did your   print   display for TO DO 4?
#   (HINT: It is an INTERESTING number.)  Get help if your value is wrong.

# TODO: 5.
#   Look at the list of files in this project to the left.
#   Note that this file (m2_hello_world.py) is now displayed in a blue
#   font color (if the file is highlighted select a different file so yu can
#   see the blue font color).  That means that you have made changes to
#   this file which have not yet been committed.
#
#   COMMIT your work by selecting VCS from the menu bar, then select Commit Changes
#   Make sure only the files you want to commit are checked and optionally
#   add a quick Commit message to describe your work.  Then hover over the
#   Commit button and select Commit and Push.  Commit saves the work to
#   your computer.  "and Push" saves a copy of your work up into your Github
#   repository (saving to the cloud is a better way to permanently safe work).
#
#   Oh, one more thing:
#   Do you have any blue bars left on the on the scrollbar-like thing
#   to the right?  If so, click on each blue bar and change
#   its TO DO to DONE.  Then run the file (to make sure you didn't break
#   anything) then Commit and Sync again.
#
#   You can COMMIT as often as you like.  DO FREQUENT COMMITS.
