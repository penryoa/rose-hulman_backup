This folder contains finished examples that can be run to demo different robot features.
You can reference the code in this folder when doing your own work.  There are no TODOs in this folder.

Note: this folder never uses the robot_controller.py library since it is made to be independent of that library.  It pretends like that library isn't written at all yet since you will be writing it.
In real programs that you make you will use your library heavily.  So often your code will be MUCH more concise than the examples shown here.
