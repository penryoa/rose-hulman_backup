"""
Shows an example of using both Tkinter and MQTT together in a program.  Messages typed into the entry box will be
sent to the MQTT broker and shared with other people on your team running the program.

In order for this example to work the following must be true:
 - Must have installed mqtt-paho (we did this together many days ago)
 - Must right click the libs folder and select Mark Directory as --> Sources Root

This example runs purely on your computer and does not require the use of the EV3.

Extra credit:
The LEGO_NUMBER for your team is saved in the mqtt_remote_method_calls.py file.  If you wanted to temporarily modify
it to spy on a another team for fun go ahead.  I recommend not committing that change though.
