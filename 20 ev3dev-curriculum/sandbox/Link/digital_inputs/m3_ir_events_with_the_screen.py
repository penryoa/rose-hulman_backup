"""
In this module you'll practice using the IR Remote using event callbacks.  You'll find the process works the same
as buttons.  There are 6 buttons (up, down, left, right, enter, and back) and 16 IR remote buttons (4 buttons *
4 channels).  We will only use lambda callbacks for this example since that is the easiest way to do everything once
you are comfortable with the lambda syntax.

Your task will be to display different images on the screen when certain IR buttons are pressed.  Working with the
screen is easy if you use the `chmod +x m3_ir_events_with_the_screen.py` command, then run the program from the Brickman
interface.  If you want to use SSH to run the program though you first need to stop the Brickman programming from
running so that your screen images stay visible for more than 1 second.  You can keep the Brickman UI program stopped
until you complete this problem.

To stop the Brickman interface type:
  sudo chvt 6
When prompted for the password - C$$E120

To restart the Brickman interface after you complete this problem type:
  sudo chvt 1
Which will probably not require you to type the password since sudo was just run earlier.

BTW chvt means CHange the Virtual Terminal, and 86ing something means to kick it out.
