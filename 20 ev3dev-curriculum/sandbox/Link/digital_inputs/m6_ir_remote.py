  This is your opportunity to work as a team on a mini-project.  You will need to handle the following actions.

  When your program starts it should say IR Remote, print instructions, and do a robot.arm_calibration()

  IR remote channel 1 to drive the crawler tracks around:
    -- Pressing  red up   makes the left  LED turn green and the left_motor  move at  600.
         Releasing turns off the LED and stops left_motor.
    -- Pressing  red down makes the left  LED turn red   and the left_motor  move at -600.
         Releasing turns off the LED and stops left_motor.
    -- Pressing  blue up  makes the right LED turn green and the right_motor move at  600.
         Releasing turns off the LED and stops right_motor.
    -- Pressing blue down makes the right LED turn red   and the right_motor move at -600.
         Releasing turns off the LED and stops right_motor.
    You should be able to use one red (left) button and one blue (right) button at the same time.  For example:
     while pressing both red up and blue down the robot should spin and LEDs will be green (left) and red (right).

  IR remote channel 2 to raise and lower the arm
    -- Pressing red up   calls robot.arm_up().
    -- Pressing red down calls robot.arm_down().
    -- Pressing blue up  calls robot.arm_calibration().

  Buttons
    -- Pressing the Back button will allow your program to end.  It should stop motors, turn on both green LEDs, and
       then print and say Goodbye.  You will need to implement a new robot method called shutdown to handle this task.
