This module lets you practice using button events with callback functions.

You will use both the simple callback approach, when no additional data needs to be passed, and
the more complex callback approach that uses lamdba when data needs to be shared.

Since this module is all about the buttons the Sound code has just been provided as a finished
example.  You will call different Sound functions using different buttons.

#     You can leave the print messages below, just add the new requirement stated above.
#   handle_down_button - when state is True (a press), call play_song_by_notes_list()

#   handle_left_button - when state is True (a press), call speak()
#   handle_right_button - when state is True (a press), call play_wav_file()
#
# Once implemented test your code by trying all four buttons.  Observe the print messages and sounds played.
