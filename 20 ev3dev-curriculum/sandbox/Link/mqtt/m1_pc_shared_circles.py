"""
The goal for this module is to ease you into learning the MQTT library api (the MqttClient class within
libs/mqtt_remote_method_calls.py). To make your life easier many of the TODOs in this module simply say to
"uncomment the code below".  This code is run on your computer and does not use an EV3 robot at all.

The goal is for you to think about how the MQTT library works.  You need to:
 -- Create a class to serve as your message recipient (your delegate)
 -- Construct an instance of your delegate class and construct an instance of the MqttClient class
    -- Pass the instance of your delegate class into the MqttClient constructor
 -- Call one of the .connect methods on the MqttClient object to connect to the MQTT broker
    -- The connect method you use will establish what topic you are publishing to and what topic you are subscribing to.
 -- Use the send_message command to call methods on the delegate that is on the opposite end of the pipe.

In addition to the MQTT goals, this example will show some tkinter tricks:
  -- How to capture mouse clicks and process the X Y locations
  -- How to draw circles onto a Tkinter Canvas.

"""  # DONE: 1. PUT YOUR NAME IN THE ABOVE LINE.


# DONE: 2. Select one team member to open libs/mqtt_remote_method_calls.py and complete the TO DO that is in that file.
# After making that change, they should commit their work and all other team members should do a VCS -> Update
# After all team members see that file changed you can move on to the next TO DO
# Also someone should update the libs/mqtt_remote_method_calls.py file on the robot too (at some point before bockke).

# DONE: 3. Run this program as is on your computer and watch the logs as you click in the window.
# Next see if you can review the code to see how it works.  You can do this individually or as a team.
