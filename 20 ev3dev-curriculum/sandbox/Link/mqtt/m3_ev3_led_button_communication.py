The goal of this module is to practice doing MQTT communication.  In this module you will only write code that runs on
the EV3.  The code that runs on the PC (m3_pc_led_button_communication.py) is already written for you.  You will need to
implement this module, run it on your EV3, then at the same time run m3_pc_led_button_com.py on your computer to do the
communication.  Summary of the communication:

  EV3 receiving (you will be writing this code in this module, running it on EV3):
      The EV3 will have a delegate that has a method called "set_led" which receives two strings:
        led_side_string (the first parameter) will be either "left" or "right"
        led_color_string (the second parameter) will be either "green", "red", or "black"
      When the EV3 receives a set_led message from the PC it will set the appropriate LED to the appropriate color.
      Warning, the strings must be converted into appropriate values before using the ev3.Leds.set_color method.

  EV3 sending (you will be writing this code in this module, running it on EV3):
      The EV3 will send an mqtt message to the PC whenever the Up, Down, Left, or Right button is pressed on the EV3.
      The method name sent will be "button_pressed" which will have 1 parameter (sent as a List with 1 item)
         The parameter sent will be the either ["Up"], ["Down"], ["Left"], or ["Right"] (always a List with 1 item)

  PC receiving (this code is already complete in m3_pc_led_button_communication.py, which will run on your PC):
      The PC will have a delegate that has a method called "button_pressed" which receives 1 string:
        button_name (the only parameter) will be either "Up", "Down", "Left", or "Right"
        That method is already done and it displays the result to the Tkinter gui window.

  PC sending (this code is already complete in m3_pc_led_button_communication.py, which will run on your PC):
      The PC will send an mqtt message to the EV3 whenever a Tkinter button is clicked.
      The method name sent will be "set_led" which will have 2 parameters (sent as a List with 2 items)
        The first parameter will be either "left" or "right"
        The second parameter will be either "green", "red", or "black"
      That method is already done and it will send when buttons are clicked on the Tkinter GUI.

Implement the TODOs below to complete this module, then transfer the file to the EV3 (as done in many previous units),
  then run this module on the EV3 while at the same time, running m3_pc_led_button_communication.py on your PC.
