"""
This module contains code that needs to run on an EV3 (notice the filename).

You shouldn't look at this code at all.  It's intentionally mysterious and that's part of the fun of this module.
It's a puzzle you have to solve.  If you look at the code it'll give away the fun. :)

All of your coding will be done within m4_pc_petals_on_a_rose.py, open that file.

# DONE: 1. Have someone on your team run this module on the EV3.  It uses the screen on the EV3.  Whenever you want to
# use the screen you can't just run it via SSH like normal.  You instead have 2 options:
#  chmod +x this file on the EV3 by using the SSH command chmod +x m4_e (hit tab for the rest), then run it via Brickman
#  Temporarily stop Brickman while working on this module, then resume Brickman once complete.
#  Stop via       sudo chvt 6
#  Restart later  sudo chvt 1
# Personally I prefer to stop Brickman and use SSH but either option works.  By doing it the chvt way you get some logs.
#
# Once the program m4_ev3_petals_on_a_rose.py is running on EV3, open m4_pc_petals_on_a_rose.py.
# Don't look at any other code in this file (that's cheating in this game).
