This module lets you practice refactoring code to use a shared library.  The code in this file is already finished.
The team should work together and pick one team member to type code into libs/robot_controller.py to create a
constructor and a method called drive_inches.

Authors: David Fisher and Maroon5.
"""  # DONE: 1. PUT YOUR NAME IN THE ABOVE LINE.

# DONE: 2. On your computer right click on the libs folder in PyCharm, select Mark Directory as... Sources Root
#   That should fix the error on the import robot_controller as robo line below (expand the imports below)
#   Marking that folder as a Source Root will allow any module in that folder to be used globally in this project.
#   Note, when that folder is uploaded to the EV3, it wil be in the folder /home/robot/csse120/libs
#   That folder path is special on your robot because it is set as the PYTHONPATH (done within the .bashrc file)
#   Normally you can't just use a module in some random folder, but the libs folder has been setup special.

# DONE: 3. Have everyone talk about this problem together then pick one team member to modify libs/robot_controller.py
# as necessary to make the code below perform the same task as the prior module. As mentioned in the top doc-string for
# the file, you may not modify the code below.  Warning, make sure you UPLOAD the library to the robot before running
# this module.
#
# Once the code has been tested and shown to work, then have that person commit their work.  All other team members need
#  to do a VCS --> Update project...
# Once the library is implemented each team member should be able to run their version of this code on the robot.

# DONE: 4. Formally test your work. When you think you have the problem complete run these tests:
#   500 dps 24 inches
#   500 dps -24 inches
#   Should work exactly as before with these tests and more.  It should beep after the movement is over.

# TODO: 5. Call over a TA or instructor to sign your team's checkoff sheet and do a code review of your library.
#
# Observations you should make, you are a TEAM and making great library methods will make life easier for everyone.
