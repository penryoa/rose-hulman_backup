"""
The goal of this module is to let you practice with color detection with the Pixy.
You will use the Pixy to beep when blue is placed in front of the Pixy camera.  You first need to setup signature 1 on
the Pixy to detect blue using Pixymon before starting to implement this module.

You should print out the x, y, width, and height readings from the Pixy (much like the print_pixy_readings example).

If the width reading is greater than 0 then you should make your robot beep.  If you are getting false positives (the 
robot beeps thinking blue is present, but no blue is present) try setting the threshold higher than 0 (see what works
for your environment). After a beep wait for at least 1 second to avoid lots of annoying beeps.
