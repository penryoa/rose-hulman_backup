"""
The goal of this module is to let you practice with monitoring distance with the IR sensor.
You will use the IR Sensor's proximity property to beep when a hand is placed in front of the robot.

If the proximity is less than 10 then beep.  After a beep time.sleep(1.5) to allow them to remove their hand.
Check every 0.1 seconds for a hand and print the proximity value each check.

Setup the program to continue to run until the user presses the touch sensor.
