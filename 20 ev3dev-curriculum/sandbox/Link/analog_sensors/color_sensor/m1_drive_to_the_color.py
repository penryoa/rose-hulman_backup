"""
The goal of this module is to let you practice with driving and color sensing.  You need to
have a few color squares placed in a line in front of the robot.  The robot should drive over
the color squares and stop at the appropriate color (ignoring incorrect colors until the target
color is found).

Here is a link to a Google doc that has color squares that you can print (in color)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ed_vWTfOu15ziF8nfZwhjrRcSufKODhQtAmY8lsGNAc/edit?usp=sharing

If the user presses the Up    button, the robot drives until the robot gets to Red.
If the user presses the Down  button, the robot drives until the robot gets to Blue.
If the user presses the Left  button, the robot drives until the robot gets to Black.
If the user presses the Right button, the robot drives until the robot gets to White.
