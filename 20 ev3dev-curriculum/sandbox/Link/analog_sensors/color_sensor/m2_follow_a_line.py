"""
In this module you will practice using the reflected_light_intensity property of the color
sensor.  This module uses a command line input to:

w - Calibrate the white value. Put the robot on white and determine what value is a white surface.
      This value will be passed into the follow_the_line function.
b - Calibrate the black value. Put the robot on black and determine what value is a black surface.
      This value will be passed into the follow_the_line function.
f - Follow the line until the touch sensor is pressed.  You are allowed to assume in your code
     that the line only ever goes straight or turns to the right (your robot will never turn left).
     Extra - For a harder challenge could you drive on the black line and handle left or right turns?
q - Quit

# Observations you should make, following a black line would be easier with 2 sensors (one on each side of the line),
