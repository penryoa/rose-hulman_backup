"""
This module demonstrates BUILDING-UP a new SEQUENCE,
one item at a time, using the ACCUMULATOR pattern.
  -- We will later see a more efficient way to build-up and/or modify
        sequences, namely by MUTATING their elements.

    # Here is the Accumulator pattern for building up LISTs:
    #
    #   1. BEFORE the loop, initialize the list variable
    #         (the "accumulator") to the empty list [].
    #
    #   2. LOOP, appending items one at a time (each time thru the loop)
    #
    #   3. INSIDE the loop:
    #
    #        a. Use   +  to concatenate:
    #             -- the existing list, and (followed by)
    #             -- the one-element list containing the new item
    #           thus constructing a new list with the new item appended.
    #
    #        b. Re-assign the list variable to the NEW list.
    #
    #   4. AFTER the loop, the variable is the entire "built up" list.
