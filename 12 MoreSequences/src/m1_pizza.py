    What goes out: Nothing (i.e., None).
    Side effects:
      See the   'fancy_polygon'   pictures in the   pizza.pdf   file in
      this project; they may help you better understand the following:

      1. Draws the given rg.Circle in the given rg.RoseWindow.
      2. Constructs and draws   rg.Line   objects to make the picture
           look like an inscribed regular polygon with the given number
           of segments, but with each rg.Line going from one point
           on the given rg.Circle to the point on the given rg.Circle
           that is the given number of 'hops' away (wrapping as needed).
         Each rg.Line has the given color and thickness.
         Each rg.Line should be drawn as an arrow,
           by setting the rg.Line's   arrow   instance variable
           to the string   'last'.

         For example, if  hops_to_next_point   is 1,
            then the picture is a regular polygon.

         Or, if   hops_to_next_point is   2, the lines go:
           -- from point 0 to point 2
           -- from point 1 to point 3
           -- from point 2 to point 4
           -- from point 3 to point 5
           -- etc.

         One more example:
           if   hops_to_next_point   is 3
           and  number_of_segments   is 5, then the lines go:
           -- from point 0 to point 3
           -- from point 1 to point 4
           -- from point 2 to point 0 (note the 'wrap' effect)
           -- from point 3 to point 1
           -- from point 4 to point 2

      file in this project.

    # IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT:
    #    You MUST USE (call) the   generate_points_on_circle
    #    (defined above) to generate the relevant points,
    #    and then draw lines that are based in part on those points.
