"""
This module demonstrates why MUTATION is DANGEROUS:

Example 1:
  -- A function has a error (it mutates a parameter when it shouldn't).
  -- That error does not become apparent in testing the function,
     but the error messes up ANOTHER function that CALLS the first one.

Example 2:
  -- The author constructs a BankAccount with $1,000 savings.
  -- She shows her checking and savings balances.
       Surely that is safe!
  -- But unbeknownst to her, evil David has put nasty code into the
       show_balances   method, that steals the rest of her savings!
  -- So her money is now gone!

Authors: David Mutchler, Amanda Stouder, Chandan Rupakheti, Katie Dion,
         Claude Anderson, Delvin Defoe, Curt Clifton, Matt Boutell,
         and their colleagues.

#           could NOT steal her money!
