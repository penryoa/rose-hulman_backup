"""
This module demonstrates various patterns
for ITERATING through SEQUENCES, including:
  -- Beginning to end
  -- Other ranges (e.g., backwards and every-3rd-item)
  -- The COUNT/SUM/etc pattern
  -- The FIND pattern (via LINEAR SEARCH)
  -- The MAX/MIN pattern
  -- Looking two places in the sequence at once
  -- Looking at two sequences in parallel

Of course, these are not the only patterns, and some problems require
combining these patterns, but this is a good base upon which to build.
