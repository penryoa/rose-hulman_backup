# Rose-Hulman Code Backup
In my years at Rose, I've had many opportunities to improve how I code by working either on solo or group projects for different types of classes. From CSSE120 to CSSE433, there is a significant improvement in the parts I coded, though not all projects differentiate what I specifically worked on. This code base purely exists to document and reference much of the code I have played significant roles in creating.

Peruse the different branches to see different course work.
