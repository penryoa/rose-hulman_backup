# CSSE374: Software Design and Architecture
The purpose of this project is to create a Java app that takes in Java files and outputs an accurate UML diagram, or at least a string that can be entered into <http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000> and turned into a UML diagram. 

Even moreso, it captures design patterns such as Adapter pattern or Decorator pattern. The README file in the project folder explains how to use the app.

Peruse the code as you wish :)
