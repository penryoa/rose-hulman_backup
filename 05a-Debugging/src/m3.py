"""
This module lets you practice DEBUGGING when LOGIC ERRORS occur.

That is, no run-time exception occurs, but the function simply
does not do the right thing.

# TODO: 2. READ these instructions, ASKING QUESTIONS as needed.
#
#   This module contains "broken" functions, as in m1 and m2.
#   FOLLOW THE SAME STEPS as in the instructions of m1.py
#   to find and correct the mistakes in these functions.
#
#   The broken functions in here have LOGIC errors.
#   The code does NOT break when you run it,
#   but it does not produce the correct output.
#
#   In THIS module, the mistakes may be ANYWHERE in the module
#   EXCEPT:
#     -- The  is_prime  function below is correct.
#     -- The tests themselves are correct.
#
#   *** IMPORTANT: ***
#       Resist the urge to "fiddle" with the code until you stumble
#       upon something that works.  This exercise will be helpful
#       to you ONLY if you use it as an opportunity to learn
#       what the error messages mean and how to react to them.
#
#   *** ASK QUESTIONS AS NEEDED! ***
#
#   When you believe you understand these instructions,
#   change the above TO DO to DONE.

    Examples:
