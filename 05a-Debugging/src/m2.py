"""
This module lets you practice DEBUGGING when RUN-TIME EXCEPTIONS occur,
focusing here on AttributeError exceptions:
  'BLAHType' object has no attribute 'FOO'
  
and on TypeError exceptions, in particular those of the form:
  'BLAHType' object is not callable.

# TODO: 2. READ these instructions, ASKING QUESTIONS as needed.
#
#   This module contains "broken" functions, as in m1.py.
#   FOLLOW THE SAME STEPS as in the instructions of m1.py
#   to find and correct the mistakes in these functions.
#
#   The broken functions herein have the SAME SPECIFICATIONS
#   as those in the  m1  module.  Therefore, you can use the
#   SAME PICTURES (in the file m1_pictures.pdf) as you used
#   for determining whether your corrected code passes the tests.
#
#   *** IMPORTANT: ***
#       Do NOT look back to m1.py to solve THESE problems.
#       That would greatly diminish what you learn from THESE problems.
#
#   *** IMPORTANT: ***
#       Resist the urge to "fiddle" with the code until you stumble
#       upon something that works.  This exercise will be helpful
#       to you ONLY if you use it as an opportunity to learn
#       what the error messages mean and how to react to them.
#
#   *** ASK QUESTIONS AS NEEDED! ***
#
#   When you believe you understand these instructions,
#   change the above TO DO to DONE.
