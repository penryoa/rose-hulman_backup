"""
Example showing for tkinter and ttk how to:
  -- Put an IMAGE on a Button (or anything else).
  -- Also have text if you want.

Note: The image file for tkinter/ttk must be a GIF (or one of several
      other unhelpful formats).  PIL -- Python Imaging Library --
      is the standard library for converting images in Python.
      An unofficial port of PIL to Python 3 is available on the
      course web site (under the Graphics section) of Resources.

Authors: David Mutchler and his colleagues

    # The next line is necessary when your root.mainloop() call is outside the 
    # current method. Tkinter has a bug that makes it think the image is ready for 
    # garbage collection, which makes the image fully transparent.
