#   This line is a COMMENT -- a note to human readers of this file.
#   When a program runs, it ignores everything from a  # (hash)  mark
#   to the end of the line with the  #  mark.
#
#   We call files that have Python code in them MODULES.
#   Line 1 of this module (look at it now) prints (displays) the STRING
#      Hello, World
#   on the Run window (to the right).
#
#   Anything surrounded by quote marks (single or double) is a STRING.

# TODO: 1.
#   (Yes, that means for YOU to DO things per these instructions:)
#
#   Run this module by right clicking anywhere in this window and selecting
#        Run 'name of file'
#   Or, use the keyboard shortcut:  Control + Shift + Function-F10
#
#   After running, find the Run window (to the right) and confirm that
#        Hello, World
#   did indeed get printed (displayed) on that window.

# TODO: 2.
#   Notice the small horizontal BLUE bars on the scrollbar-like thing
#   on the right.  Each blue bar indicates a thing TO-DO in this module.
#
#     a. You can use the blue bars to go from one TO-DO to the next
#        by clicking on the blue bars.  ** Try that now. **
#
#     b. When you have completed a TO-DO, you should change the word
#          _TODO_      (ignore the underscores on this line)
#        to
#          DONE
#        Try it now on line 20 above, and note that its blue bar on
#        the scrollbar-like thing to the right has gone away.
#
#   If you change TODOs to DONEs like this, you can tell when you have
#   finished all the exercises in a module -- there will be no blue bars
#   left on the scrollbar-like thing to the right.
#
#   You have now completed TO-DO #2, so change its TO-DO on line 35 to DONE
#   (and proceed similarly for all forthcoming TODOs in this course).

# TODO: 3.
#   Add another   print   statement below the current Line 1 above.
#   It should print any string that you want (but keep it G-rated!)
#
#   Test your code by re-running this module, either by proceeding as you did
#   when you ran this module the first time, or by pressing the green-triangle
#   "Play" button that is on the toolbar at the top of this window.
#   Look at the Run window to be sure that your string printed as expected.
#

#
# TODO: 4.
#   Add yet another   print   statement.
#   This one should print the *product* of 3,607 and 34,227.
#   Let the computer do the arithmetic for you (no calculators!).
#   You do NOT have to use strings for this, so no quotation marks!
#
#   TEST your code by re-running this module, then asking someone
#   whom you trust:  What number did your   print   display for this TO-DO?
#   (HINT: It is an INTERESTING number.)  Get help if your value is wrong.

# TODO: 5.
#   Look at the list of files in the Project window (to the left).  Note that
#   this file (m2_todo_and_commit_push.py) is now displayed in BLUE.
#
#   The BLUE font color means that you have made changes to this file which
#   have not yet been COMMITTED to version control and PUSHED to the cloud.
#
#   COMMIT and PUSH your work by:
#     1. Select   VCS   from the menu bar (above).
#     2. Choose  Commit  from the pull-down menu that appears.
#     3. In the  Commit Changes  window that pops up:
#          - HOVER over the  Commit  button
#              (in the lower-right corner of the window)
#          - CLICK on  Commit and Push.
#
#   COMMIT adds the changed work to the version control on your computer
#   and PUSH adds the changed work into your Github repository in the "cloud".
#
#   PyCharm forces you to add a  Commit  message intended to describe
#   your work to teammates, but until your team project use   Done
#   or whatever you want for the  Commit  message.
#
#   Always PUSH (in addition to the COMMIT) so that your work is backed-up
#   in the cloud, and also so that your instructor can access it as needed.
#   If you COMMIT but forget to PUSH, you can subsequently do the PUSH by:
#      VCS ~ Git ~ Push...
#
#   Oh, one more thing:
#     Do you have any blue bars on the scrollbar-like thing to the right?
#     If so, click on each blue bar and change its TO-DO to DONE,
#     then run the file (to make sure you didn't break anything)
#     and COMMIT-and-PUSH again.
#
#   You can COMMIT-and-PUSH as often as you like.  DO IT FREQUENTLY.
